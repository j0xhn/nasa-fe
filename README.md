# Not A Serious Application
Many of the problems we encounter are when dealing with complex situations,
but my hope is that this will be a proving ground for simplifying complex things.
To be used when needed to express a new pattern or organization thought.

Please create/fork a branch if you felt necessary to change file structure, if not feel free to leave comments or make changes as you see fit in order to illustrate a point.

This is a learning excersize and communication tool, let's not take anything here to seriously.

## Getting Started

`npm i && npm start` should get you up and running.  
It's working off node version `10.15.3` incase that is an issue.
